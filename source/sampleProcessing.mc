// add here functions to post process HR data once we have it!
// This should contain all the data collection and stats generation
// sample data etc is kept in Storage and properties class

// Measurements possible

//SDNN, the standard deviation of NN intervals. Often calculated over a 24-hour period. 
//SDANN, the standard deviation of the average NN intervals calculated over short periods, usually 5 minutes. 
//	SDNN is therefore a measure of changes in heart rate due to cycles longer than 5 minutes. 
//	SDNN reflects all the cyclic components responsible for variability in the period of recording, therefore it 
//	represents total variability.
// SDNN can be measured over shorter time intervals but assumes abnormal beats have been removed. RR measure = NN with abnormal peaks removed
//RMSSD ("root mean square of successive differences"), the square root of the mean of the squares of the successive 
//	differences between adjacent NNs.
//SDSD ("standard deviation of successive differences"), the standard deviation of the successive differences between adjacent NNs.[36]
//NN50, the number of pairs of successive NNs that differ by more than 50 ms.
//pNN50, the proportion of NN50 divided by total number of NNs.
//NN20, the number of pairs of successive NNs that differ by more than 20 ms.
//pNN20, the proportion of NN20 divided by total number of NNs.

// Note geometric patterns need 20m-24hrs!

//Frequency domain methods assign bands of frequency and then count the number of NN intervals that match each band. 
//The bands are typically high frequency (HF) from 0.15 to 0.4 Hz, low frequency (LF) from 0.04 to 0.15 Hz, and the 
//very low frequency (VLF) from 0.0033 to 0.04 Hz.

// Analysis has shown that the LS periodogram can produce a more accurate estimate of the PSD than FFT methods for typical RR data. 
//Since the RR data is an unevenly sampled data, another advantage of the LS method is that in contrast to FFT-based methods it is 
//able to be used without the need to resample and detrend the RR data.

// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation
//The following two formulas can represent a running (repeatedly updated) standard deviation. 
//A set of two power sums s1 and s2 are computed over a set of N values of x, denoted as x1, ..., xN:

//s(j)=sum [k=1 to N] (x(k)^j)

//Given the results of these running summations, the values N, s1, s2 can be used at any time to compute the 
//current value of the running standard deviation:

//sigma = sqrt (N*s(2)-s(1)^2)/N
//Where N, as mentioned above, is the size of the set of values (or can also be regarded as s0).

//Similarly for sample standard deviation,

//s= sqrt ((N*s(2)-s(1)^2) / (N*(N-1)) ).
//In a computer implementation, as the three s(j) sums become large, we need to consider round-off error, 
//arithmetic overflow, and arithmetic underflow. The method below calculates the running sums method with
// reduced rounding errors. This is a "one pass" algorithm for calculating variance of n samples without the 
//need to store prior data during the calculation. Applying this method to a time series will result in 
//successive values of standard deviation corresponding to n data points as n grows larger with each new sample, 
//rather than a constant-width sliding window calculation.

//For k = 1, ..., n:

// A(0)=0
// A(k)=A(k-1)+ (x(k)-A(k-1))/k
//where A is the mean value.

// Q(0)=0
// Q(k)=Q(k-1)+ (k-1)/k*(x(k)-A(k-1))^2 = Q(k-1)+( x(k)-A(k-1) )( x(k)-A(k) )
// Q(1)=0 since k-1=0 or x(1) = A(1)

// Sample variance:
//	s(n)^2 = Q(n)/(n-1)

//Population variance:
//	sigma(n)^2 = Q(n)/n

// RMSSD = sqrt( sum squares: (NN(i)-NN(i-1))^2 / Number of samples)
