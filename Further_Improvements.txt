Future ..

1. Add another screen maybe based on poincare or HISTORY showing plot of rMSSD, NNX against sample number
	X axis would be scaled buffer length
	Y-axis selectable statistic selected by menu like current history graph
	
2. A screen showing advice based on HRV trend
	Could be a bar chart or like WHoop strap colour coded to show some status
	Could look at history and curve fit then use trend to say whether rising or falling
	possible to build a 30 day baseline (avg) on the app and give advice 
	(perhaps colour coded - red, yellow, green like seen on the whoop strap or the HRV Stress Test on Garmin devices itself) on how hard to train on a given day ? 
	Most HRV apps or Watches use some sort of Red, Green, Yellow Gauge to advice the user what to do
	
3. Widget version of app
	Could require HRV analysis app to pass history if we want to use this using change of context
	Would be limited to 2 min by watchdog
	Could capture it's own history and do screen similar to (2)
	use this widget reading to compare it against the 30 day avg baseline and use a color coding on the widget ? To see if you should be able to train or not. 
	At best color coded and easy to interpret
	
4. Is there also a possibility to trigger a reading 2-3 minutes before you actually wake up ? Some kind of automatic stuff
